# Copilot Instructions for Geometry Project

<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

This is an experimental advanced geometry workspace focused on:

- Mathematical computations for geometric algorithms
- 2D and 3D geometric transformations
- Computational geometry research and experiments
- Visualization of geometric concepts

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use NumPy for numerical computations
- Prefer clear, mathematical naming conventions
- Include docstrings with mathematical notation when appropriate
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Keep functions focused on single geometric operations

## Libraries in Use

- NumPy: For numerical arrays and mathematical operations
- Matplotlib: For 2D plotting and visualization
- SciPy: For advanced mathematical functions
- Optional: SymPy for symbolic mathematics

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for geometric entities (point, vector, line, etc.)
- Use mathematical notation in comments when helpful (e.g., Î¸ for angles)
- Prefix experimental functions with `exp_` to indicate work-in-progress
